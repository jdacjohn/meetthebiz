<p>"As a graduate of a 4-year acting program at a university<br>
I used to think I didn't need any extra-acting classes. <br>I
decided to take some of DSZ's meet the biz classes to
network and keep my acting chops up, but I have gained
so much from every single instructor DSZ has brought in.
The diversity of the instructor's backgrounds is amazing.
One week you have an esteemed film actor and director,
the next you have a seasoned casting director, and then a
producer. writer will come in and give you his perspective
of casting and running the film as a business and what he
expects from actors. The actor in me has gained so much.
The writer in me has learned a lot, but the person I am; has
been enriched by the weekly meetings with the very talented
and inspired group of actors and David Zimmerman
himself."
<p align="right"> -Nicholas Sarando (Actor)</p></p>


<p style="height:20px;"></p>

<p> "When I take David's class, his care and passion allow 
me to trust that I'm in a safe, creative place - where I can 
explore everything I have to give as an actor.  David helps 
me block out the rest of the world and be entirely in the 
moment and in the work.  That's gold!  David is generous 
with his heart, knowledge and skill - I always lose myself 
in his class... and am amazed when three hours have 
passed. You will laugh and cry - while you learn - with
this amazing teacher."

<p> David Zimmerman's "Meet The Biz" classes are absolutely
invaluable in educating how to make the "biz" work for you.
Every class is introspective, and growth as an actor is
guaranteed! One not only improves his acting skills, but
even more importantly, improves the life skills necessary
to survive in the industry. Each class that I have taken,
I've walked away with the gift of greater knowledge, skill
and confidence needed to "Work the Biz"!
