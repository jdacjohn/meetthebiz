<strong><a name="lainie">LAINIE KAZAN</a></strong>&nbsp; <a href="#best" style="font-size: 11px; color:#bd8a5c;">back to top</a><br>
LAINIE KAZAN is the embodiment of the word entertainer -- and artist who has reached the pinnacle in virtually every area of 
performance. She has come a long way since she was Barbra Streisand's Broadway understudy in "Funny Girl." 
Once she was able to display her electrifying talent in two shows, she became the "Chanteuse" of her native New York, 
with nightclub stints and guest appearances on virtually every top variety and talk show in network television, including 
an unparalleled 26 appearances on "The Dean Martin Showx." She even hosted her own variety special for 
NBC and opened the popular "Lainie's Room" and "Lainie's Room East" at the Los Angeles and 
New York Playboy Clubs.

<p>In 1983, Lainie received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in Richard Benjamin's "My Favorite Year," 
	starring Peter O'Toole. Other films include "Lust in the Dust" with Tab Hunter and Divine, "Delta Force" with 
	Chuck Norris, "Beaches" with Better Midler and Barbara Hershey and "Harry and the Hendersons" directed by Steven 
	Speilberg. Additional credits include the Disney film "The Cemetery Club," "29th Street" with Danny Aiello, 
	"The Associate" with Whoopi Goldberg, "Love is All There Is" with Renee Taylor,

</p>

<strong><a name="bruce">BRUCE VILANCH</a></strong>&nbsp; <a href="#top" style="font-size: 11px; color:#bd8a5c;">back to top</a><br>
One of the most sought-after joke smiths in the entertainment industry, Bruce Vilanch has become a recognizable face in his own right, thanks to the feature-length documentary "Get Bruce!" (1999) and his one-time stint as a regular on "Hollywood Squares", for which he also served as head writer.

<p>Known for his eclectic eyewear and collection of unique T-shirts, he began as a child model for Lane Bryant, but when his initial efforts as an actor came to naught, he became an entertainment writer for the Chicago Tribune instead. Impressed by his review of her cabaret performance in 1970, Bette Midler hired him to punch up her act where he gave birth to Midler's famed Sophie Tucker jokes. He later moved to Los Angeles where he wrote for variety shows like the original "Donny and Marie" and "The Brady Bunch Hour" (both ABC) and provided material for Richard Pryor, Lily Tomlin and Joan Rivers. He has maintained his connection with Midler through the years, working on such projects as the feature "Divine Madness" (1980) and the TV special "Bette Midler--Diva Las Vegas" (HBO, 1997), as well as writing for her short-lived but lively sitcom, "Bette!" (CBS, 2000 ).
</p>
<p>Vilanch began contributing to Academy Awards telecasts in 1989, collaborating with the likes of Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg and David Letterman, and graduated to head writer in 2000. He has roasted celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor and President Clinton. The Whoopi connection led to his providing the notorious material Ted Danson performed in blackface at a certain 1993 Friars Club roast of his then-girlfriend Goldberg, but his resume also includes "You Made Me Watch You", the touching Emmy-winning valedictory Midler crooned as a send-off to Johnny Carson.
</p>
<p>He scripted most of the Academy Awards telecasts over the last decade, two of which won Emmys, including the one featuring Billy Crystal's Hannibal Lecter entrance. Mr. Vilanch has also written for The Tony's, The Grammy's, The Emmy's, and just about every other award show to brighten your television screen. He also participates and volunteers at almost every charity function, especially those dealing with GLBT issues.
</p>
<p>Bruce was a major hit in the touring company of the  Broadway hit, "Hairspray" playing Edna Turnblad.  
</p>
<p>His new film "Oy Vey! My Son is Gay!!" was just released!</p>

<strong><a name="lindsay">LINDSAY WAGNER</a></strong>&nbsp; <a href="#best" style="font-size: 11px; color:#bd8a5c;">back to top</a><br>
Lindsay Wagner makes little distinction between her life as an actress, advocate, mother, humanitarian or author.   What unites these various parts is a commitment through her work and her personal life to advancing human potential.  Early in her career this commitment was evident in her Emmy Award winning portrayal of "The Bionic Woman".  Her use of media as a way to communicate ideas to help people in their personal process is demonstrated in so many of her films. 

<p>Films such as:  "Shattered Dreams" on spousal abuse and domestic violence starred in and co-Produced by Lindsay in 1991; "The Taking of Flight 847" on the root complexities of terrorism (1988); "Evil In Clear River" on the quiet rise of the Neo-Nazi movement in America (1988); "Child's Cry" on child sexual abuse (1985);  "I Want To Live" on the moral dilemma regarding capital punishment (1983); and "The Incredible Journey of Doctor Meg Laurel" on the battle between the naturopathic and allopathic healthcare (1979).
</p>
<p>Off screen, Lindsay continuously works both publicly and privately in advocacy and public education.  She shares the knowledge and experiences, which have greatly impacted her life and have profoundly enhanced her awe of our often unrecognized human potential.  Lindsay has co-authored two books: a best-selling vegetarian lifestyle cookbook entitled, The High Road to Health (Simon & Schuster) and a book on acupressure, Lindsay Wagner's New Beauty: The Acupressure Facelift (Simon & Schuster).  
</p>
<p>From 2003-2006 Lindsay co-facilitated a support group for convicted batterers and their families.  In 2004 she co-founded "Peacemakers Community", a non-profit organization that offers families and individuals more constructive and peaceful ways of relating to each other and oneself in order to help end the cycle of family violence.  Her work utilized a range of psychological techniques and Spiritual encouragement. 
</p>
<p>For the public, Lindsay has been offering experiential "Quiet the Mind & Open the Heart" retreats and workshops. These programs are designed to help us access more deeply the peace and joy which is naturally within us and to realize how the conscious and unconscious concepts we carry in the mind often have a life diminishing influence on others and ourselves.  For many, it can be the catalyst needed to break through old or undesirable patterns affecting our family dynamics, intimate relationships, self-image, parenting, friendships and our work/career.

<strong><a name="ann">ANN WALKER</a></strong>&nbsp; <a href="#best" style="font-size: 11px; color:#bd8a5c;">back to top</a><br>
<p>In April of 2001, Ann completed the 10-month Los Angeles run of Del Shores' newest play, Southern Baptist Sissies. Her portrayal 
	of Odette Annette Barnett garnered her a Robby Award, a Maddy award, as well as the prestigious Los Angeles Drama Critics 
	Circle Award and a nomination from her peers for The Ovation Award. Ann happily returned to Dallas, Texas last year to play 
	Odette again in "Southern Babtist Sissies" to SRO houses.
</p>
<p>Los Angeles theater-goers have enjoyed her in other award-winning productions such as Tyler Hansen's 
	"Ballad" (for which she received a Drama-Logue award and the Robby Award for Best Actress in a Drama), "Rain", 
	"Best Wishes", "How The Other Half Loves", "Hysterical Blindness", "Opera Comique", "Steel Magnolias", "The Glass
	Menagerie", "Daughters of the Lone Star State" by Del Shores. Ann's biggest joy in her theatrical career came in 
	1996 with Del's other big comedy hit SORDID LIVES in which Ann originated the enduring and beloved LaVonda Dupree, 
	a role she reprised in the award winning film in 2000.
</p>
<p>SORDID LIVES played to delighted audiences in many cities around the U.S. and Canada but the phenomenon that 
	occurred in Palm Springs, California astounded everyone. The movie played for an extraordinary three years in Palm Springs. In April of 2002, the mayor proclaimed two days as SORDID LIVES DAYS IN PALM SPRINGS.
</p>
<p>This wild Texas comedy has a following that crosses all groups of people, gay/straight, young and old.
</p>
